# MYGO 

**M**odel of **Y**east **G**lycolytic **O**scillations

Simple model of yeast glycolytic oscillations adapted from Bier et al (Biophys. J. 78, 1087-1093, 2000; https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76667-7) and encoded in PySB. 

This model is given as an example and discussed in Week 2 - Lecture 8 (slides 7-10) of the [Dynamical Modeling Methods for Systems Biology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dynamical-modeling) course on Coursera.
